### About

Crosswords is a browser-based application that lets you generate sparse
crossword puzzles out of a given set of words. Sparse means that the
puzzle will not be arranged to completely fill a rectangular region
(this would correspond to a dense crossword puzzle).

Some of the most important features include:

* words and hints can be specified independently
* you can cycle through all possible crossword variants that can be
generated from a given set of words
* crosswords can be rotated
* crosswords can be printed in a teacher variant (includes words and
hints)
* crosswords can be printed in a student variant (includes blanks for
words or hints)
